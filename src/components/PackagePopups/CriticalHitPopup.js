            As a Genesis Land NFT holder, you can participate in the daily
            Critical Hit event to earn points and rewards. Each day, you need to
            log in to the game and visit your land. On your land, you have a
            Genesis Gem, which you need to break with a pickaxe. Once broken, it
            gives you either points that are added to your leaderboard rank on
            BNB Chain or direct rewards in BNB.
